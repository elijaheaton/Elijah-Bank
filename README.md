# Elijah-Bank
This is a work in progress for a bank with imaginary money. Currently you can create and access an account without a password. It shouldn't work for you because I have it configured to my local database. To change that to your MySQL database, go under server.cpp and change the global variables for username and password.

Dependencies: G++, MySQL

To execute, just use the following code!

```
git clone https://github.com/elijaheaton/Elijah-Bank.git
cd Elijah-Bank
make
./bank
```
